       We are very much focused on testing products n their appropriate environment.  To us, that is in peoples homes.  Typically, we recruit 200 consumers in 2-3 different cities and have them attend a tasting session.  They are free to pop in within a 2 hour band.  This is usually after work, so these sessions usually run from 5-7pm.</p>
<p>They are held at a lead consumer’s home, and our team comes in in the afternoon to set the session up.  Product is delivered to the home by our client, and we prepare the tasting.  Be it cutting cheese, pouring milk, distributing yoghurt, heating ready meals, pouring beer or cooking pasta, our team has everything ready by the time the first consumer arrives.</p>
<p>We test a maximum of three ‘flights’ in each tasting, with a maximum of four products in each flight.  Typically, we would prefer not to test more than 9 products in one tasting.</p>
<p>Client provides the incentives to consumers in the form of product – this is valuable to brand ‘buy-in’, allowing panel members to feel that they are part of a greater whole – members of an evaluative team and is also a more cost effective way of incentivising respondents.

      <p>While once off tasting panels are on offer, we prefer our clients to sign up for a yearlong set of tasting panels. These usually comprise 6 panels a year.</p>
<p>Our clients usually have a relatively set range of consumers they would like to have taste their products, so the tasting panel for a particular client usually comprises the same set of people returning over time to engage with a variety of products. If this is not the case, though, ‘fresh’ respondents can be recruited for each panel – although this does come at additional cost.</p>
<p>If any additional research is required (branding, pack, advertising etc), we refer you to our parent company, Vibrand Research.  There are no silos between the companies, and all information gleaned from the tasting panels will be passed onto the Vibrand team. </p>
