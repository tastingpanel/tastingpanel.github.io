      Most of our panels are run in South Africa.  We regularly conduct panels in Johannesburg and Cape Town, but can organise panels in all 9 provinces if necessary.</p><p>
While we donâ€™t often conduct tasting outside of South Africa, the Vibrand Group has an extensive Africa wide network; conducting research in 54 developing countries. Using this network, we are able to conduct tasting panels in many African countries on request.
