      Most of our panels are run in South Africa. We regularly conduct panels in Johannesburg and Cape Town, but can arrange panels in all 9 provinces if necessary.</p><p>
We have an extensive Africa and Middle Eastern network, conducting research in 54 developing countries. Using this network, we are able to conduct tasting panels in many African countries. Using this network we have already conducted tasting panels in 5 African countries!</p><p>
We work with some great clients on many well-known and much-loved brands – we’d love to work with you on yours!
