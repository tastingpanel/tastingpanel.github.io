  We are serious about testing products in their appropriate environment.  To
  us, that means in peoples’ homes.  Typically, we recruit 200 consumers in 2-3
  different cities and have them attend a tasting session. Find out more here.

      <p>We are serious about testing products in their appropriate environment. To us, that means in peoples’ homes. Typically, we recruit at least 100 consumers based on your unique requirements in 1-3 different cities and have them attend a session. They are free to pop in within a convenient 2 hour window, usually after work, so the sessions typically run from 5-7pm.</p><p>
The exception to this is in countries outside of SA, where we generally use central locations rather than people’s homes.</p><p>
Our sessions are held at a lead consumer’s home, and our team arrives during the afternoon to ensure a professional set up. Sample product is delivered directly to the home by our client, and we do all the preparation necessary. Be it cutting cheese, dishing up yoghurt, heating ready meals, pouring beer or cooking pasta, our team has everything ready by the time the first consumer arrives.</p><p>
We test a maximum of three groupings in each panel, with a maximum of four products in each grouping. Typically though, we would prefer not to test more than 9 products in one session.</p>    </div>

      <p>Our clients generally provide incentives to consumers in the form of product or product vouchers – not only is this valuable to brand ‘buy-in’, allowing panel members to feel that they are part of a valued brand assessment team, it is also a more cost effective way of incentivising respondents.</p><p>
While once off panels are on offer, our clients generally prefer to sign up on an annual basis, during which time we would typically conduct 6 panels.</p><p>
Our clients frequently have a relatively fixed set of consumers they would like to have sample their products, so the tasting panel for a particular client often comprises the same group of respondents returning over time to engage with a variety of products. If preferred, ‘fresh’ respondents can be recruited for each panel – although this does come at additional cost.</p>
