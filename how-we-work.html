  We are serious about testing products in their appropriate environment.  To
  us, that means in peoples’ homes.  Typically, we recruit 200 consumers in 2-3
  different cities and have them attend a tasting session. Find out more here.

      <p>We place great value on evaluating products in their appropriate environment. To us, that means predominantly in peoples’ homes where they are actually used. We don’t believe in testing booths, laboratory settings, external sensory elimination and the like. We are interested in evaluating products in real life environments. We believe this creates a relaxed, realistic consumer experience which delivers superior, more accurate results. It also brings cost savings that are passed onto our clients.</p><p>
To achieve this, we use one or a combination of methods, depending on the project objectives and product type. </p>

      <h3>Central Home Testing</h3>
      <p>Where a panel of consumers, typically 40 at a time, are invited to participate during a convenient 2 hour window in a lead consumer’s home and hosted by an expert member of our team. This is ideal for sensory study of food, beverages , packaging and product concepts.</p>

      <h3>Home Usage Testing</h3>
      <p>Where product is delivered to our consumer panels at their respective homes, and tested over a period of time.  This is typically used for items such as cleaning products and cosmetics, or even foods when we are investigating usage patterns.</p>

      <h3>In-store Testing</h3>

      <p>While our research is quantitative in nature, through our sister company Vibrand Research, we can add qualitative focus groups to our Central Home Testing panels to probe specific areas.  We are able to offer these at a competitive rate as we use the same in-home venue and a subset of the existing panel.</p><p>
Recruitment is key to the quality of our outputs and is performed by leading professionals in their field with whom we have long-standing relationships.  Specific demographic, lifestyle and product usage criteria are applied to the recruitment of our consumer panels based on the unique requirements of each client or project, and various options exist:
