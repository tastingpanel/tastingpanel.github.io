       We are serious about testing products in their appropriate environment.  To us, that means in peoples’ homes.  Typically, we recruit 200 consumers in 2-3 different cities and have them attend a tasting session.  They are free to pop in within a convenient 2 hour window, usually after work, so the sessions typically run from 5-7pm.</p><p>
Our sessions are held at a lead consumer’s home, and our team arrives during the afternoon to ensure a professional set up.  Sample product is delivered directly to the home by our client, and we do all the preparation necessary for the tasting.  Be it cutting cheese, pouring milk, dishing up yoghurt, heating ready meals, pouring beer or cooking pasta, our team has everything ready by the time the first consumer arrives.</p><p>
We test a maximum of three groupings in each tasting, with a maximum of four products in each grouping.  Typically though, we would prefer not to test more than 9 products in one tasting.</p><p>
Our clients provide incentives to consumers in the form of product – not only is this valuable to brand ‘buy-in’, allowing panel members to feel that they are part of a valued brand assessment team, it is also a more cost effective way of incentivising respondents.

      <p>While once off tasting panels are on offer, our clients generally prefer to sign up on an annual basis, during which time we would typically conduct 6 panels.</p><p>
Our clients frequently have a relatively fixed set of consumers they would like to have sample their products, so the tasting panel for a particular client often comprises the same group of respondents returning over time to engage with a variety of products. If preferred, ‘fresh’ respondents can be recruited for each panel – although this does come at additional cost.</p><p>
If any additional research is required (branding, packaging, advertising etc.), we refer you to our parent company, Vibrand Research.  There are no silos between the companies, and all information gleaned from the tasting panels will be passed onto the Vibrand team. </p>
