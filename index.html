  The Tasting Panel conducts tasting panels! We convene (typically) 200
  consumers in relaxed home environments where we offer them blind tastings of
  products. They are asked to fill out a questionnaire, which is carefully
  designed by our expert team.

      <p>Welcome to The Tasting Panel, sister company to Vibrand Research, which is known for its innovative but practical approach to corporate market research.</p><p>

The Tasting Panel specializes in the tools associated with sensory research – a scientific discipline that applies the principles of experimental design and statistical analysis to the use of human senses for the purposes of evaluating consumer products. We apply these statistical tools to product testing (taste testing) and also to product, pack and concept testing. Simply put, we collect & analyse data on your consumer’s tastes and preferences to make recommendations on your product offerings!</p><p>

The extension of our offering to pack, product and concept testing means that we can provide a holistic service to our clients:</p><p>
      <ul><li>We can test a cream cleaner as easily as we can test an ice cream</li>
        <li>We can test pack designs while we test product formulations</li>
        <li>We can test concepts for future products while we evaluate current product formulations.</li></ul></p><p>
In short, if you can conceptualise, make or package it, we can test it with consumers – scientifically, and to a statistical (near) certainty.  And if more depth qualitative work is necessary, the team at Vibrand Research will happily assist in convening focus groups to test pack, concept, product and advertising in a more conventional way.</p><p>
Depending on the project and the range of products to be tested we convene at least 100 consumers in relaxed home environments where we expose them to products, packaging or concepts. This could take the form of food and beverages, where products are physically tasted, or household or personal products that are put to the test, right there and then!  They are asked to fill out a questionnaire, which is carefully designed by our expert team. The complexity of the questionnaire depends on the nature of the project (<a href="http://thetastingpanel.co.za/our-toolbox.html">see our toolbox</a>), but we prefer to keep things as simple as possible.

<p>We place great value on evaluating products in the environment in which they are used. We believe this creates a relaxed, realistic consumer experience which delivers superior, more accurate results.</p><p> It also brings cost savings that are passed onto our clients</p><p>
From yoghurts to razors to cosmetics, pies to floor cleaner, we will find a way to test it.
So whether you are deciding to launch a new product, tweak an existing one, introduce a limited edition, or evaluate competitor products against your own – The Tasting Panel can provide the answer – from concept through to actual product and final packaging!</p><p>
Worried there is too much garlic in your Chicken a la King? That your label is too dull? That your yoghurt is not fruity enough? That your kitchen cleaner leaves residue or that your packaging will not stand out on shelf?</p><p>
Want to know whether your competitors’ ice cream is better than yours? What new flavours or fragrances are likely to hit the spot this summer? Or do you need to choose which of three new variants to launch?</p><p>
We’ll recommend the right approach from our <a href="http://thetastingpanel.co.za/our-toolbox.html">toolbox</a> - from the simple to the complex; from the 2 product face-off to multi product preference mapping; from JAR (Just About Right) to cluster to principal component analysis, we have the methodology to meet your needs.
To answer any product related questions you may have, The Tasting Panel has the solution.
